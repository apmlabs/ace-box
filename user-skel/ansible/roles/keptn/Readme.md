## Using the role

### Role Requirements
This role depends on the following roles to be deployed beforehand:

### Deploying Keptn

The main task deploys Keptn on a Kubernetes cluster. It is recommended to add a condition whether cloud_automation_flavor is "KEPTN" as shown below.

This task:
 - ensures Gitea is installed when we are using Keptn to have auto repository provisioning.
 - installs Keptn-CLI on the ACE-Box. 
 - creates an ingress using Nginx Ingress Controller or a virtual service using Istio depending on your choice
 - installs keptn-jmeter, keptn-dynatrace, keptn-helm, keptn-synthetic, keptn-test-collector, keptn-job-executor services when enabled in the role defaults.

```yaml
- include_role:
    name: keptn
  when: cloud_automation_flavor is defined and cloud_automation_flavor == "KEPTN"
```

Variables that can be set are as follows:

```yaml
---
keptn_version: "0.16.1"
keptn_dynatrace_service_version: "0.23.0"

keptn_cli_download_location: "/tmp/keptn"
keptn_look_and_feel_url: "https://d2ixiz0hn5ywb5.cloudfront.net/branding.zip" # uncomment to give keptn the cloud automation look and feel
